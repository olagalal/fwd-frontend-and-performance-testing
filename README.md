# FWD - Front End & Performance Testing

✨ This repo contains my projects for FWD - Front End & Performance Testing. 

## Projects
### Project 1: Sales Invoice Generator
In this project, I am required to create a "Sales Invoice Generator" using Java programming language.

A sales invoice is an accounting document that records a business transaction. It provides the business with a record of the services they’ve provided to a client, when the services were rendered and how much money the client owes the business.

Typically, a sales invoice will include a description of the service provided and the amount owed. Sales invoices are crucial to small-business accounting because they enable you to record transactions of your sales for bookkeeping purposes.

I am required to make a Java-based desktop application "Sales Invoice Generator" to help our customers (Businesses) automatically generate and retain the history of transactions the business has.
